[hh]UMIL[/hh]

UMIL (Unified MOD Install Library) is a utility that enables MOD Authors to create simple installation scripts for their MOD that allow the user to install, update, or uninstall a Modification quickly.
Released under the GNU GPL license, UMIL is included within MOD Packages to make MOD Installations simple and automatic.

UMIL performs basic database actions that would be required to install a MOD; UMIL does not perform file edits.
AutoMOD is the tool of choice for file edits and installing MODs from a MODX file. AutoMOD does not perform module, permission installations, etc.; this is the purpose for which UMIL was developed.

What can UMIL do?

The Unified MOD Install Library can perform any of the following operations as specified by a UMIF (Unified MOD Install File) provided by the Modification:
[list]
	[*]Add, update, or remove configs[/*]
	[*]Add or remove modules[/*]
	[*]Add or remove permissions[/*]
	[*]Set or unset permission options from roles and groups[/*]
	[*]Add or remove database tables[/*]
	[*]Add, update, or remove table columns[/*]
	[*]Add or remove table keys/indexes[/*]
	[*]Purge / Refresh Caches[/*]
[/list]
